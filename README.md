Quickly shows the template used for current page, number of queries, and execution time for PHP code.

## Description

A fast/small debugger integrated into the WordPress Admin Bar, made for identifying the template used for displaying current page.

It was built for fast debugging old projects or other people's work.

It adds some other  potentially useful informations in the dropdown list:
* the current theme (useful for child themes)
* total queries on current page
* execution time
